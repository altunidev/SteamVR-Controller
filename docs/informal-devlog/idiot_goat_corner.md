## heyyy :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 

I stumbled upon this git repo and I want in :3 

So basically, what I have over here is a couple of etee controllers and thus I have the access to the way etee did

And basically :3

The controllers are all separate from the trackers :3

So here is an alternate way to look at things:

How do we get a wireless controller to be recognized in SteamVR?

Could be anything at first :3

okay I'm gonna

## Okay, so.

In a more serious note, I have realized that, due to etee's willingness to support other trackers than just their own, they've worked it so that the controllers themselves are considered separate from the trackers.

Oh, hello. I'm NordGeit. I usually want to focus on MMD and some other artistic endeavours, but with the Norwegian market and actually solid consumer laws proving itself to have poor conductivity for certain companies, it means that the Index knuckles are near-impossible to come by, especially if you want to RMA them if they break. I will hold myself primarily to this little corner.

Now, back to etee.

You can buy an attachment from them to use different trackers than their own, since the controllers needs a feature that is also on their own trackers to save space or something.

[Tutorial here](https://eteexr.com/pages/eteeadatper-guide)

They do use the same dongle to connect their own trackers and controllers, might actually prove to be part of the usability issue here, but I digress.

Essentially, when you connect the controllers to etee's trackers or adapter, it adds an extra sensor, but otherwise just charges the trackers themselves. Might want to re-check that, but a couple of plonks of varying economic affluence, both low-class, can not easily afford the 2000£ evaluation kit that would allow us to dive a little further into etee's APIs and whatnot.

What this DOES open up, however, is the possibility of making this project a little easier.

My proposal to this project is that we change the initial focus into something else entirely: Making a thing that SteamVR looks at, and recognizes as a "controller".

## Milestone 1 refocus

- [ ] Get anything with buttons and a joystick (heyy, what are these three controllers of varying brands and makes on my desk doing?)
- [ ] Get them to be recognized as a controller in SteamVR
    - How did etee do it?
    - How did other people do it?
    - Can we nab some source code or do we have to ask nicely?
- [ ] Using either 3D-printing or silly amounts of tape or zip-ties, attach a tracker (Heyyy, an unused Vive Tracker 2, 2018 edition!)
- [ ] Make it recognized as a right or left hand and make it reasonably synced
- [ ] Walk around and point at random people in vrchat with it

Upon success, and maybe a little extra work to reduce any input delay from, say, a translation layer if we need to, we can then start

## Milestone 2

- [ ] Make controller guts
- [ ] Get THAT to be recognized in SteamVR
- [ ] Stick it in a 3d-printed shell with an attachment point (or more tape/zipties) for a tracker, I am thinking just a tube with button holes.
- [ ] Oh, look, we have a prototype. If it works, we can move to stage 3.

## Milestone 3
- [ ] Refine it even further. Consider using a PCB making service (youtube video sponsored by PCBWay when), or a [resin 3d-printer](https://youtu.be/RudStbSApdE), in order to make it more compact, so that we can
- [ ] Make a more comfortable design
- [ ] Stop using tape and zipties to mount it and finally have an actual attachment point, will need to make an extra for the oddly shaped etee trackers
- [ ] We now have a thing. In fact, *the* thing.

## Okay, but what resources do *I* have?

Other than the previously mentioned traditional controllers, 2018 Vive tracker and etee SteamVR controllers:

- A Vive Pro setup with wireless VR
- A friend that has a 3D printer (albeit far away, so regular prototyping will be an issue lest I get my own)
- Norwegian benefit funds, so if something is REALLY necessary and costs around the Norwegian equivalent of 100-200$/€/£, I will have the spare money to get that, once a month.

Looking at the original task list, I find it impractical and... Maybe a little expensive compared to my own task list, although I believe Altuni is trying to create something that integrates smoother with SteamVR. I believe that is possible, with custom hardware and firmware, but whether he is imagining that they work like the pre-existing Vive and Index controllers, or if the trackers are considered separate, is currently bit beyond me. But if we are to consider modularity in mind, going the way of etee and making the trackers considered separate might be better.

## My own tasks?
- [ ] Getting the [eteeAdapter](https://eteexr.com/products/eteeadapter)
- [ ] Testing how that works using my own normal Vive tracker
- [ ] Get some actual screenshots of how SteamVR looks like and reacts to the etee setup


## Additional considerations

I'll be sticking anything else I found in here and merging whenever a decent chunk rolls in.

How did [HadesVR](https://github.com/HadesVR/HadesVR) do it? I know nothing about software or hardware development at all, but this seems promising. Just remove the tracking part from the controllers... I sent an email (I hope it's the right one) about it. I guess it depends on how tightly the parts are interconnected. While they focus more on emulating the Vive Wand or Index Knuckles specifically in regards to input, they got an input working, it looks like. I suppose, given the knowledge, one could modify it to pretend to be something else.

I'm going to be completely honest, I'm getting frustrated over the hype for those blasted [DIY gloves](https://github.com/LucidVR/opengloves-driver). Did they seriously choose to make gloves before releasing a basic controller API thing? Anyways, for anyone technically competent, is there something from this we'll be able to harvest?

I'd rather spend 3 years getting a bachelor's in linguistics at the terrible place that is the Norwegian capital Oslo just to invent a specific word to describe the sheer stupidity of everyone gathering into one closed monolithic service to organize everything when it's not needed than to use Discord, so someone else will have to go in there and talk with them for me, or convince them to work with me and set up a Matrix Bridge. I rent a VPS and have my homeserver there, so on that note it shouldn't be much of an issue. Haven't found the dev's emails yet.
