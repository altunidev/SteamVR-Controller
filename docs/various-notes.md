                - Updated for 2018 design -- using Vive Tracker 2.0 design. Found essentially by replacing the guide version number in the URL. Downloaded PDF's for the purpose of archiving documentation (if there is an issue with this, please reach out). I believe the Vive Tracker 3.0 mainly had alterations to the form factor (to be smaller) and battery (to be longer), however much of the functionality remains the same.
    - The above few bullet points ultimately, some digging led me to this: https://developer.vive.com/resources/hardware-guides/vive-tracker-developer-guidelines/
        - Which lead me to the appropriate documentation for the Vive Tracker 3.0: https://developer.vive.com/documents/850/HTC_Vive_Tracker_3.0_Developer_Guidelines_v1.1_06022021.pdf
            - which now I have a [local copy here](assets/HTC_Vive_Tracker_3.0_Developer_Guidelines_v1.1_06022021.pdf).
